" Regression is a supervised machine learning technique used to model the relationship of one or more features or independent variables, (one = simple regression, more = multiple regression) to one or more target or dependent variables, (one = univariate regression, more = multivariate regression). The variables are represented by continuous data.

A regression algorithm attempts to find the function that best 'mimics' or 'models' the relationship between independent feature(s) and dependent target variable(s). The algorithm does this by finding the line (for simple regression) or plane (for multiple regression) that minimizes the errors in our predictions when compared to the labeled data. "
